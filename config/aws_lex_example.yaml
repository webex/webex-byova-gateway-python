# Example AWS Lex Connector Configuration
# Copy this file and modify as needed for your environment

# IMPORTANT: AWS credentials are NOT configured here for security reasons.
# Use environment variables, AWS profiles, or IAM roles instead.
# See README.md for detailed credential configuration instructions.

aws_lex_connector:
  # Required: AWS region where your Lex bots are located
  region_name: "us-east-1"
  
  # Note: Bot aliases are discovered automatically. The connector will use
  # the most recent alias for each bot. WxCC admins select which bot to
  # route to on the WxCC side.
  
  # Optional: Initial trigger text sent when starting a conversation
  # Default: "hello"
  # For Bedrock agents, use a simple greeting rather than a specific request
  # to avoid triggering function calls before the agent is ready
  initial_trigger_text: "hello"
  
  # Optional: Barge-in configuration
  # When enabled, users can interrupt the bot's response
  # Default: false (disabled)
  barge_in_enabled: false
  
  # Note: Audio conversion to WAV format is always enabled (WxCC requirement)

# Example configurations for different environments:
# Note: AWS credentials should be set via environment variables or AWS profiles, not here.

# Development/Testing
aws_lex_connector_dev:
  region_name: "us-east-1"
  initial_trigger_text: "hello"  # Simple greeting for testing
  barge_in_enabled: true  # Enable barge-in for development

# Production (use IAM roles when deployed to AWS infrastructure)
aws_lex_connector_prod:
  region_name: "us-east-1"
  initial_trigger_text: "hello"  # Simple greeting
  barge_in_enabled: false  # Disable barge-in for production (default)

# Custom bot configuration
aws_lex_connector_custom:
  region_name: "us-west-2"
  initial_trigger_text: "hi"  # Different greeting for custom bot
  barge_in_enabled: true  # Enable barge-in for custom bot
